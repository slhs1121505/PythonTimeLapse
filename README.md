# PythonTimeLapse

> There are definitely others who can do it better or with more features, but idc. I'm just a beginner, doing it for fun. Not like anyone else is gonna use this anyway, lmao.

## 🎥 About

This is a screen time-lapse recording tool I wrote in Python.  
It lets you record your screen at a custom FPS and then play it back at a chosen speed. You can export the video using **H.264** or **H.265** encoding.

Built with 💻 Python and packed into an `.exe` with `pyinstaller` — so no need for Python or any setup to use it.

## ⚙️ Features

- Set your own FPS (frames per second)
- Choose playback speed (like 2x, 5x, etc.)
- Encode output in **H.264** or **H.265**
- Lightweight, no installation needed — just run the `.exe`

## 📦 How to Use

1. Download the `.exe` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/slhs1121505/PythonTimeLapse/releases/tag/chickenjockey) section.
2. Double-click it to launch.
3. Set your FPS and speed, then start capturing!
4. When you're done, it exports a time-lapse video.

> 📝 No Python or dependencies needed — it's fully standalone.
